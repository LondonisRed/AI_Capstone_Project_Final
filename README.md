Handwritten Digit Recognition Capstone Project

Project Overview:
This capstone project focuses on the study of handwritten digit recognition.

Libraries Need:

 	- Numpy 
  	- Matplotlib 
   	- All are on lastest version.

Code Execution:


Prepare the Workspace:

Place the following files in the same directory:

	- AI_project_main.py
	- AI_project_lib.py
	- mnist_test.csv
	- mnist_train.csv
	- All documents related to recognition present in this repository.

Change the workspace directory to ensure you are in the correct location.



Code Execution Steps:

	- Open AI_project_main.py.
	- Execute the code block by block.
	- Launch the first three blocks.
	- Do not execute the fourth block, as the learning process is already completed, and necessary documents are in the .zip file.
	- Execute the fifth block to create the confusion matrix for digit 0. Modify the 89th line if you want to detect a different digit.
	- Execute the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th blocks to display confusion matrices for all different digits.



Demonstration Blocks:
The last three blocks are for demonstration purposes.
	- The first block detects which digits are on the first 10 lines.
	- The second block recognizes only the digit present on the i-th line. Modify the 154th line to change the line, and the block will display the image of the digit.
	- For the third block, open the .png file in the .zip with Paint. Change the digit by modifying the image. Ensure a perfectly black 	  	  	  background and write with white. Save the image and launch the code.
